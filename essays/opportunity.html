A <b>product opportunity</b> is a a product that doesn't exist yet, but
would be profitable if it did.  This essay answers the question of how
these emerge by introducing a novel model called the <b>product graph</b>,
which extends neoclassical economics to derive cost and demand curves
from relationships with other products in the economy.
</p>

<p>
New products don't have to come from startups, but they often do, and
the conversation around new products is so often focused on startups
that this is where we must look for existing work.
</p>

<p>
It turns out there's not much there.  Some authors do talk about how
to find good ideas, but they don't say much about how good ideas arise
in the first place.  In <i>Zero to One</i>, Peter Thiel writes that the new
ideas are the "valuable companies that no one is building."  This is
vacuously true.  It's more of a definition, almost identical to the
one I gave for "product opportunity" above.  It doesn't say much.
What makes a product profitable? How does it become profitable?  Why
are new products profitable when they weren't before?
</p>

<p>
Paul Graham is probably the most broadly prolific startup author, and
he has in fact written <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">an essay</a> on how to find ideas, but even PG
hasn't written about that crucial step that comes before getting good
ideas - how the opportunity appears in the first place.
</p>

<p>
In the management theory community, there's Christenson of <i>The
Innovator's Dilemma</i>, who covers some specific instances of the
catalysts for new products, but stops short of developing a coherent
theory.
</p>

<p>
In economics, elementary supply/demand expositions such as those in
Mankiw do cover some of the factors leading to cost and demand, such
as price of the factors of production, complements, and substitutes,
but this again stops short of deriving the cost and demand curves from
these factors, and nothing is said about how changes in this system
propagate through the economy to create new opportunities.  The other
classic economic model related to the ideas in this essay is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input%C3%A2%8">Input-Output Matrix</a>, which does chart the relations between different
goods, but only at the macro scale of industries, not at the micro
scale of individual products.
</p>

<p>
The industry most directly interested in this topic must be Venture
Capital, whose entire M.O. is to identify and invest in new
opportunities.  But the discourse of VCs is also high-level and
imprecise.  They talk about "waves", "themes", and "thematic
investing", which are real, but only as high-level concepts emerging
from a fine-grained model such as the product graph.  I expect the VC
industry to mature in this regard, and I wouldn't be surprised if a
variant of the product graph are already secretly running in the
simulation farm for some cutting edge VC.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="unnumbered-3">Product Graph</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-3">
<p>
A <b>product opportunity</b> is a profitable product that doesn't yet
exist.  A product is profitable if, at some quantity, demand exceeds
supply, and since supply is determined by cost, we can equivalently
say that a product is profitable when demand exceeds cost.
</p>

<p>
This means that for a product to become newly profitable, either
demand must increase or cost must decrease.  That's it.  That's how
new product opportunities emerge.  One or both may happen, but a
product can only become viable when these curves shift.  This defines
two types of new products:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Newly desirable products</b>.  Something increased their demand.
These are the products we didn't want before, but do now.  No one
wanted the light bulb before there were electric generators to
power them.</li>

<li><b>Newly possible products</b>.  Something decreased their cost.  A new
technique or a new component became available.  These are the
products we've wanted for a while, but couldn't build.  Drivers
have wanted electric cars for ages, but they were prohibitively
expensive before lithium ion batteries.</li>
</ol>

<p>
To understand the factors that contribute to demand and cost, I now
introduce a novel model called the <b>product graph</b>.  The product graph
is a directed graph, where nodes are products and edges are production
relationships.  The sources are raw materials such as labor, minerals,
and energy sources.  The sinks are consumer products.  Intermediary
nodes are business products including those used for design,
manufacturing, and distribution. The following is an informal
description of this graph.  For a complete set of equations from which
the graph is derived, consult <a href="https://github.com/mgummelt/economics/blob/master/src/main/scala/Product.scala">this set of functions</a>, written in a mix
of Scala and math notation.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with a single product, P.  A product used in the
production of P is called an <b>input</b> to P.  Economists might call this
a <b>factor of production</b>, but my definition is a bit more broad.  It
includes not only the components used in the product and its
manufacture, but also the techniques.  This includes hardware
manufacturing techniques like assembly-line production and exchangeable
parts, as well as software techniques like dependency injection and
the observer pattern.  It may seem like a stretch to call these
"products", as they must be to deserve the status of nodes in the
product graph, but it's not as much as you might think.  Consider the
example of the Raft consensus protocol, which is a distributed systems
technique introduced in 2014.  It's certainly not a product in the
traditional sense, but a software package implementing the protocol
would undeniably be a product (with price=0 if it were open source).
And since the implementation of a protocol is simply a "rephrasing" of
the technique from natural language to formal language, it would be
silly to consider one a product but not the other.
</p>

<p>
The entire set of inputs used to produce P is called a <b>suite</b>.  There
are likely many suites that could produce P.  They compete for P's
business, and P will choose the cheapest <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.  Members of a suite are
<b>complements</b> of each other, and members of competing suites are
<b>competitors</b>.  These relationships defines the demand and cost curves
for each product.
</p>

<img width="400px" src="../img/production_relationships.png"/>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: You may be thinking that price isn't P's only concern, but
also quality.  That P will choose not just the cheapest, but also the
best suite..  This is a valid point assuming that P can vary in
quality, but the product graph as presented in this essay assumes
static products, as described in the section on <i>future work</i>.  While I
assert that this is a sound model, I admit that this isn't typically
how we think about products, especially highly dynamic products like
modern software, and if I were to continue working on the product
graph, dynamic products would be the next phenomenon to tackle.
</p>

<p>
Cost is simple to compute.  For a given quantity of P, P's cost is the
price of the cheapest suite that will produce that quantity of P.
</p>

<p>
Demand is more complex.  I again invite you to reference <a href="https://github.com/mgummelt/economics/blob/master/src/main/scala/Product.scala">the complete
model</a> for the full demand equation, but at a high level, demand goes
up when:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The price of a complement goes down.  The product may now take a
larger portion of the profit margin allocated to the entire suite.</li>

<li>The price of a competitor goes up.  The product may obtain new
outputs now that a competitor is more expensive.</li>

<li>The demand for an output goes up.  If the product has a monopoly on
its role in production of the output, this increase in demand
transfers to the product.</li>

<li>The cost of an output goes down.  See #3.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If this all seems too abstract, consult the <i>examples</i> section.
</p>

<p>
A product's inputs and complements share many properties, so we
collectively call them <b>partners</b>.  We'll also define the price of a
non-existent product to be infinite, so if a new product enters the
market, we can say that it's price has decreased from infinity to some
finite value.  With these simplifying definitions, we now have a
complete set of three changes to the product graph which may cause a
product to become newly profitable:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>demand for an output goes up (may increase demand)</li>
<li>price of a partner goes down (may increase demand or decrease cost)</li>
<li>price of a competitor goes up (may increase demand)</li>
<li><del>cost of an output goes down (may increase demand)</del></li>
</ol>

<p>
#4 implies #2, so we can remove it.

<h3 id="unnumbered-4">Propagation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unnumbered-4">
<p>
Altogether, there are four properties of a product and its neighbors
that define its profitability: cost, demand, quantity, and price.  The
graphs below show how changes in these properties flow through the
economy.  Each graph shows local changes only, but one need only to
compose the graphs to understand the possible emergent effects.
</p>

<p>
<b>Demand</b>
</p>
<img align="center" width="70px" src="../img/cause_demand.png"/>

<p>
Except for theoretical products with perfectly elastic demand, an
increase in demand always results in an increase in quantity.  And
though the conventional rule of thumb is that demand and price are
also directly proportional, this isn't always the case.  For a product
with sufficient economies of scale and sufficiently inelastic demand,
an increase in demand may actually decrease price.
</p>

<p>
Normally, an input's demand is a function of its output's quantity,
not its demand, at least not exactly.  However, if the input and
output don't yet exist, then increasing the demand of the output may
increase the demand for an input that will enable production, even
though quantity=0.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cost</b>
</p>
<img align="center" width="100px" src="../img/cause_cost.png"/>

<p>
Costs going up means marginal cost meets marginal revenue at a lower
quantity, and since this intersection determines the quantity a firm
will produce, this quantity is reduced.
</p>

<p>
<b>Quantity</b>
</p>
<img align="center" width="100px" src="../img/cause_quantity.png"/>

<p>
Quantity may increase for many reasons.  We saw above that it is
inversely proportional to cost.  It also increases when the product
first lands on the market (zero to one), and continues to rise as
production ramps up to meet the firm's most profitable quantity (where
marginal cost equals marginal revenue).  Regardless of its source,
increasing quantity means we traverse down a decreasing demand curve
with price decreasing accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Price</b>
</p>
<img align="center" width="500px" src="../img/cause_price.png"/>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, a change in price has the most complex effect on the
surrounding economy.  It's directly proportional to the demand of both
its inputs and competitors, inversely proportional to the demand
of its complements, and raises the cost of its outputs.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-5">
<p>
This section includes many examples, including at least one for each
of the three catalysts described in the <i>product graph</i> section, but by
far the most comprehensive is that of electricity, which shows how the
introduction of new knowledge, Faraday's laws, triggered changes in the
product graph for over a dozen products related to electricity in the
19th century.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="unnumbered-6">electricity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unnumbered-6">
<p>
Before the 1830s, the only way to create electricity was chemical -
voltaic piles.  But in 1831, Faraday demonstrated the link between
electricity and magnetism, leading the way to the first electric
generators.  The next half century saw the market evolve a network of
products to produce electricity, and most importantly light.
</p>

<img align="center" width="500px" src="../img/electricity.png"/>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="0">1831 - Faraday's laws of electromagnetism emerge as a new
product, which enables the creation of electric dynamos.</li>

<li>1830s The first generators are created, bringing down the cost and
price of electricity.</li>

<li>As electricity drops to a reasonable price, demand for light bulbs,
its complement and hitherto non-existent product, rises.  Bulbs are
now in demand, but cost is too high, which in turn increases the
demand of the inventions necessary for creating a light bulb.</li>

<li>Sprengel Pump is invented, making the discovery of an incandescent
filament even more valuable. (1865)</li>

<li>Carbon filament discovered, finally enabling the creation of
modern light bulbs. (1879)</li>

<li>Light bulbs begin to be manufactured, increasing the demand for
electricity.  This in turn increases the demand for an electric
grid, which can provide electricity at much higher economies of
scale than a generator.  This increase in demand propagates all the
way down to a steam turbine. (1879)</li>

<li>Steam turbine is invented. (1884)</li>

<li>Edison Jumbo Dynamo is invented, the first dynamo powerful enough
to power a city. This drops the cost of an electric grid. (1880s)</li>

<li>Pearl Street Station opens, dropping the cost and price of
electricity.  This increases the demand for electricity's
complement, the light bulb.  Since light bulbs have such high
economies of scale, this increase in demand actually reduces the
price.  (1882)</li>

<li>The main competitor to the light bulb, the gas lamp, decreases in
demand accordingly, increasing the demand for a new complement to
the gas lamp - the gas mantle. The gas mantle increase the
efficiency and brightness of light from coal gas.</li>

<li>Gas mantle is invented ensuring the survival of the gas lamp into
the next century.</li>

<li>As quantity, and accordingly price, of electricity fell throughout
the 1880s, the demand for electric tramways increased, and they
were finally introduced the next decade.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This graph lets us trace the flow of new products.  We can see cost
savings propagating up, demand increases propagating down, and price
changes propagating laterally.  This value propagation begins with
Faraday, flows up to electricity, over to the light bulb, down to the
incandescent filament and back up to the light bulb, over to
electricity, all the way down to the steam turbine and back up, then
over to the tramway.

For an example of a product's demand increasing from its output's
demand increasing, I could have chosen any of the thousands of
components comprising the computer stack.  They're all inputs to
various forms of computers, whose demand has increased precipitously
since the 1960s.  As Christenson thoroughly cataloged in <i>The
Innovator's Dilemma</i>, 3.5" drives emerged to satisfy the growing
market for desktop PCs.  Desktop PCs themselves saw their demand
increase through myriad complements including applications and
internet.

profitably power a car, but the curve is approaching that level.  It's
also likely that computerized design (input.price-) and an increased demand
from the culture for environmentally friendly cars (output.demand+)
were other factors.

Bechtolsheim is one of my favorite founders due to quotes like this:

<blockquote>
<p>
"I don't see any risk.  To me, SUN was a zero risk startup, because
I knew the product would work, right, there was good demand for a
lower cost price point, it was just like getting it out the door and
selling it&#x2026;Most good startups don't have high risk."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ethernet, Unix, and 32-bit processors all arrived right around the
same time in the early 80s to enable a product like the SUN
workstation.  These new inputs alone were enough to make SUN
profitable, as outlined in their original and unusually prescient
business plan, but it was the explosion in demand after they launched
which yielded obscene profit.  Their target market was CAD developers
at manufacturing companies, but SUN soon learned that products from
diverse industries such as banks, transportation, and software
development could be improved by having workers collaborate on
networked machines.

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-12" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="unnumbered-12">Future Work</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-12">
<p>
The biggest gap in product graph as presented is that it assumes
products are static.  A changing product is represented as a new
product.  While this is a sound model, it is highly unintuitive.  When
a product gains a new feature, we don't think of it as disappearing
and being replaced by a new product.  We think of the product itself
changing.  Future work should address this, and add a feature such as
"quality", model products as feature vectors.
</p>

<p>
Another significant unmodelled phenomenon is the production function,
or the quantity of outputs a suite produces.  In order to determine
the set of outputs for a product, we must model what it can produce.
This requires a model of the features of a product, such as via a
feature vector as described above, as well as the production process.
My current perspective is that there are three production processes
that must be modeled: The design of the product, the manufacture of
the product, and the process by which new designs are created.  For
software products, the manufacture of a product is trivial, since it
simply involves copying the bits.
</p>

<p>
Culture manifests itself in our model of humans, who exist in the
model in two forms: the supply side and the demand side.  On the
supply side is labor.  Humans are just another production input, and
can be modeled similarly, with their own inputs such as education and
culture affecting their productive capacity.  What is currently
unmodelled is there role at the top of the graph.  All production flows
toward consumer products.  We could just take the demand for consumer
products as given, but we can also go further by recognizing that
what's ultimately in demand are human values, such as those you might
find on Mazlow's Hierarchy of Needs.  Modeling the production function
for consumer products, or how they produce these values is quite
complex, and often veers into the field of psychology.  One of the
main aims of commodity advertising is to manipulate this production
function.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, uncertainty is completely unmodeled, but quite important.  A
firm never fully knows the production function.  They don't know if
inputs do what they say they'll do.  This uncertainty can be modeled
as a probability distribution over the features of a product.
Products early in their life must find early customers who are either
unusually certain of their features for one reason or another, or have
a high risk tolerance.  As the product proliferates, the market
becomes more sure of the advertised claims, and certainty increases.
This process is currently modeled by the Technology Adoption
Lifecycle.

<p>
Related to the production function, switching cost, or the cost of
modifying the production process for a new input, is currently
unmodelled.

As stated in the introduction, the product graph shows how
opportunities emerge, but not how to find those opportunities.

Competitors generally don't degrade in
any strict, absolute sense, but they can degrade in some important
dimension either from some new threat entering the environment, or by
making tradeoffs.  Both modes are relevant here.
