<p>
A <a href="./opportunity.html">product opportunity</a> arises when demand is higher than cost.  So to
validate a new product, you must compute both its demand and its cost.
This essay covers demand.
</p>

<p>
I'll assume you have a product for which you're assessing demand,
rather than trying to figure out what to build.  I'll further assume
you're selling to a business <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.  How do you compute demand for such
a product?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Demand</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
</div><div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">demand = \(\Delta\) profit - switchingCost</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The demand a customer has for a product is the amount they're willing
to pay for it.  The amount they're willing to pay is the increase in
company value the product will bring, minus switching costs:
</p>

<p>
\(\mathrm{demand}(c, p)\): The amount customer \(c\) is willing to pay for product \(p\) <br  />
\(\mathrm{value}(c)\): Value of customer \(c\)'s company <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> <br  />
\(\mathrm{value}(c_p)\): Value of customer \(c\)'s company after adopting \(p\) <br  />
</p>

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{demand}(c, p) = \mathrm{value}(c_p) - \mathrm{value}(c) - \mathrm{switchingCost}(c, p)
\end{equation}

<p>
Computing switching cost is important, but it's outside the scope of
this essay.  I'll focus only on computing company value.
</p>

<p>
There are many ways to measure a company's value.  I find the most
useful to be Net Present Value, or NPV, which is the sum of all
discounted future cash flows.  So value is proportional to future
profits:
</p>

\begin{align}
\mathrm{value}(c) & = \mathrm{profit}(c)\\
\mathrm{demand}(c, p) & = \mathrm{profit}(c_p) - \mathrm{profit}(c) - \mathrm{switchingCost}(c, p)
\end{align}

<p>
But computing \(\mathrm{profit}\) can be complex.  Ideally, we'd be
able to derive an alternate formula for \(\mathrm{demand}\) only in
terms of the local effects a product has on the company.  I'll present
just such a formula below.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">company = program</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
To measure how much your product will increase your customer's profit,
you must first understand how a company's profit is determined, in
general.  Profit is defined, roughly, as <sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{profit} = \mathrm{quantity} \cdot (\mathrm{demand} - \mathrm{cost)}
\end{equation}

<p>
Your customer's product is a major determinant in this formula.  A
better product yields higher demand.  But product isn't everything.
Quantity is influenced by marketing, sales, and manufacturing.  Cost
is influenced by recruiting and procurement.  And to further
complicate matters, a company's NPV depends on not just current
profit, but <i>future</i> profit, which depends on future product
iterations.
</p>

<p>
Together, these departments form a company's <b>process</b>.  Generally
speaking, a process is anything that converts <b>inputs</b> to <b>outputs</b>.
A company's inputs are what economists call the <b>factors of
production</b>.  They're the labor, products, and services purchased by
the company.  The output is revenue, generated from product
sales <sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
The formal model for a process is a program.  Just like a computer
program defines how a function's inputs determine its outputs, so does
a company's process determine how its economic inputs generate
revenue.  If we wanted, we could model how a company operates by
writing a computer program.  To varying extents, human creativity also
plays a role in company operations, of course, but much of high level
company operations can be represented in code.
</p>

<p>
In fact, each department can be viewed as a <b>subprocedure</b>, with its
own inputs and outputs.  Recruiting turns recruiting software and
events into employees.  Marketing turns campaigns into qualified
leads.  Sales turns qualified leads into revenue.  While each
department can be arbitrarily complex, the interfaces at which they
meet and exchange deliverables tend to be quite simple, just like a
well designed program.
</p>

<p>
Your customer will integrate your product into their process, and the
amount they're willing to pay is proportional to how it affects the
output of this process, profit.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">product = subprocedure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
If we zoom in further, we'll see that a company's process is comprised
of two types of components: human and products.
</p>

<p>
I, as an engineer (and human), provide several outputs to my employer,
including design docs, help for my teammates, actions that shape
culture, etc..  But my main output is software.  My inputs are my
salary, and high level descriptions of my tasks, in the form of JIRAs,
created by my project manager.  I bring quite a bit of creativity to
this function, but at a high level, it can be fairly accurately
modeled by code.  I respond to emails off a queue.  I respond to slack
messages off a queue.  I respond to calendar interrupts telling me to
go to meetings.  For each software task, I break it into subtasks,
write the tests, write the implementation, test the code, document the
feature (if necessary), and submit it for review.  Much of my job is
mechanical.  If someone were to model my company as software, I would
be an Actor, consuming and producing messages.
</p>

<p>
Most, but not all, products also have inputs and outputs.  Simple ones
don't.  A ball, a cup, or a desk are best modeled as data, not code.
But more complex products have <b>affordances</b>, each of which have
inputs and outputs.  This is obvious for software products, but it's
also true for all but the simplest hardware products.  A camshaft
turns the rotary motion of a timing chain into the longitudinal motion
of poppet valves.  We could accurately model this function as code,
where the "processor" is the laws of physics.
</p>

<p>
Every employee and product produces intermediate values that
ultimately combine in higher level functions of the company to produce
revenue.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">demand</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
The value your product provides to your customer is the difference
between the value of its outputs and the cost of its inputs:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{value}(p) = \mathrm{value}(\mathrm{outputs}) - \mathrm{cost}(\mathrm{inputs})
\end{equation}

<p>
It's tempting to think that demand equals value, but it's not true.
Remember from above:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{demand}(c, p) = \mathrm{value}(c_p) - \mathrm{value}(c) - \mathrm{switchingCost}(c, p)
\end{equation}

<p>
This formula shows that, thanks to competition, demand for your
product is proportional to the <b>increase</b> in value it brings over its
nearest competitor, not its absolute value.  So, luckily for your
customers and unluckily for you, demand for your product could be far
less than the value it provides.
</p>

<p>
So we were close to arriving at the simple demand formula we set out
to derive, but it's not quite correct.  There is, however, a special
case where demand equals a similar formula.  This occurs when your
product's nearest competitor is a <b>direct competitor</b>.
</p>

<p>
Direct competitors share the same sets of affordances.  They have the
same inputs and outputs.  When modeled as software objects, direct
competitors have the same <b>type</b>.  Having the same type means that
your product is a drop-in replacement, so its effect on the company's
profit reduces to its effect on the inputs and outputs of the
competitor it's replacing.  Remember that demand is change in profit,
which is equivalently change in revenue minus change in cost:
</p>

\begin{align}
\mathrm{demand}(c, p) & = \Delta \mathrm{profit}(c, p) \\
\mathrm{demand}(c, p) & = \Delta \mathrm{revenue}(c, p) - \Delta \mathrm{cost}(c, p)
\end{align}

<p>
When replacing a direct competitor, change in revenue equals the
change in value of the outputs, and change in cost equals the change
in cost of the inputs:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{demand}(c, p) = \Delta \mathrm{value}(\mathrm{outputs}(c, p)) - \Delta \mathrm{cost}(\mathrm{inputs}(c, p))
\end{equation}

<p>
An example of a drop-in replacement is a processor that implements the
same instruction set as its competitor.  Its inputs are power and
code, and its output is memory state corresponding to the execution of
the code, after an amount of time proportional to the clock speed of
the processor.  The differences in power and speed brought about by
the new processor defines how much a customer is willing to pay for
the processor. <sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
So we've finally arrived at a simple, local formula for computing a
product's demand, assuming the product is replacing a direct
competitor.
</p>

<p>
But not all competitors are direct.  Your product might not be a drop
in replacement.  In general, integrating your product may require an
arbitrary amount of change in your customer's process.  Any number of
human processes might need to be reworked, new products adopted, or
existing ones rewritten.  Since these functions, rather than any
single product, must all be replaced, they are collectively your
nearest competitor.
</p>

<p>
Let's call the interface of these functions the <b>least common
interface</b>, or LCI, of the two competing processes.  The LCI is shared
by both, so it generalizes the "drop-in replacement" logic of direct
competition.  We can measure increase and value, and therefore demand,
just by looking at the change in the inputs and outputs to the LCI,
just as we did above for direct competitors:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{demand}(c, p) = \Delta \mathrm{value}(\mathrm{outputs}(\mathrm{LCI}(c, p))) - \Delta \mathrm{cost}(\mathrm{inputs}(\mathrm{LCI}(c, p)))
\end{equation}

<p>
This is the simple, local formula for demand we've been looking for,
and it applies to any type of product, both direct and indirect
competitors.
</p>

<p>
As an illustrative example, consider <a href="https://www.fivetran.com">Fivetran</a>.  Fivetran extracts data
from SaaS services into a relational database, so business analysts
can query it to inform product, engineering, etc..  The input to
Fivetran is SaaS data, which has no cost because it's not consumed.
The output is a relational database.  This output didn't exist in the
competing process, because Fivetran is not a drop-in replacement.  It
does not produce a faster or more optimized SQL database than its
nearest competitor.  Previously, business analysts likely used the UIs
or builtin query languages of JIRA, Salesforce, Github, etc..
</p>

<p>
To directly compare the value of the company before Fivetran and the
value after, we must instead compare the LCI, which in this case is
the data analysis performed by business analysts.  Modeled by code,
it's a function that consumes labor and produces insights.  Despite
the significant process reworking required to integrate Fivetran, this
interface remains the same, so it's the one we must use to measure
demand.  The demand for Fivetran is the increase in value of the
insights, minus the increase in cost of the the labor.
</p>

<p>
Quantifying the value of "insights", or many other types of outputs
for that matter, can be complex.  It requires tracing the effect of
the insight "object" through the company's process to measure its
effect on revenue.  This is straightforward for simple values close to
the sale, such as leads, but not for others.  Nonetheless, it's what
you must compute, or at least estimate, to assess demand for your
product.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Discovery</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
So now that you know precisely how demand is derived, how do you go
about computing it?  There's not much that's interesting to say about
this.  It should be clear that your customer's process is the most
important thing to understand, and you learn about it through the
familiar channels - talking to them, observing their work, shipping
prototypes, and gathering feedback.
</p>

<p>
No two company's processes are exactly the same, so it's important to
perform this discovery with a sample of companies that collectively
represent your entire market.
</p>

<p>
And the above model does make some implicit assumptions that fail to
hold in real life.  In reality, your customers don't have perfect
information.  They don't know exactly how your product will perform.
In fact, you probably don't either.  This brings uncertainty risk, for
which your customers will understandably demand a discount.
</p>

<p>
Another important exception arises from misaligned incentives within
the company.  Economists call these <b>agency problems</b>.  For all but
the smallest companies, the buyer is usually not optimizing for
company profit.  They're optimizing for their compensation, status,
and quality of life.  Rooting out these biases is necessary to
determine true demand.
</p>

<p>
Finally, while not technically an exception to the model, it's
important to understand that switching costs are really opportunity
costs.  This means that even if your product will increase profit,
your customer still might not see any value in buying if they think
they can invest their time elsewhere for a greater return.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
A customer's demand for your product is the amount by which it
increases their company's profit.  Any company's profit is determined
by their process, which converts economic inputs into revenue.  Like
any process, it can be modeled as code.
</p>

<p>
Products can also be modeled as software, even when they're hardware.
A customer will integrate your product into their process.  Demand is
the amount by which it increases their profit.  Computing this delta
reduces to computing the effect that integrating a new software
component has on output of the larger program.
</p>

<p>
If your product is replacing a direct competitor, demand equals the
increase in value of its outputs, minus the increase in cost its
inputs.  If it's replacing an indirect competitor, the same formula is
used, but on the <b>least common interface</b>, which is the minimal set of
company functions shared by both the existing process, and the new one
which uses your product.
